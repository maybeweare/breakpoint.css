# Breakpoint
A small, modular, lightning fast CSS framework. 

## Why?

Breakpoint was designed with minimalism as its core. It aims to be as inobtrusive as possible, allowing responsive websites with styles that do not need to be heavily overwritten. Other frameworks had too much visual clutter that simply did not ✨ spark joy ✨.

## Contributing

All of the source files are in the `src` directory. Only the .scss files in src directory will get bundled up into the `dist` directory.
